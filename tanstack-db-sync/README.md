# Local-First Sync with TanStack/db

TrailBase is officially supported backend for TanStack/db ðŸŽ‰:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tanstack/query-db-collection.

For a more comprehensive example showcasing the query, Electrict and TrailBase
integration, check out the official
[ToDo example](https://github.com/TanStack/db/tree/main/examples/react/todo).

The example here is a very minimal, early proof-of-concept. It pre-dates the
official one and at this point mostly serving as a jump-off point to the
official material and as a canary for us to validate the integration.
